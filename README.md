Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor stimulates production of granulocytes which are a type of white blood cell. It is sometimes used after chemotherapy. Predictions may be found in gly.out. This structure has four copies of GCSF in chains A, C, E, and G. The other chains are bound receptors. After scanning all chains for complete sidechains, gly21 is modified to only scan these chains so we can find the common potential glycosylation sites between all of the copies. These common mutation sites are shown in red.
